# ML-Project-1

🏥 Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction & Insurance Premium Estimation Using ML

🎯 Objective:
Predict whether a person is likely to develop heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle data, and estimate their potential insurance premium or risk level accordingly.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools:
📊 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🤖 Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

📈 Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, F1 Score)

💡 Feature Engineering & Correlation Heatmaps

📦 Streamlit (for dashboard) [Optional]

📂 Dataset Includes:
🧬 Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking status

❤️ Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Diabetes

🩺 ECG, Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina

💸 Insurance claim amount, annual premium

🧠 Machine Learning Flow:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹
Handled missing values, outliers, categorical encoding, normalization.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 🔍
Used boxplots, distribution plots & heatmaps to find key risk indicators.

Model Building 🤖
Applied classification models like:

✅ Logistic Regression

🌲 Random Forest

📊 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation 🎯
Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to choose the best model.

Insurance Premium Prediction 💰
Used predicted risk levels to segment customers into:

🟢 Low-risk (Standard premium)

🟡 Medium-risk (Moderate premium)

🔴 High-risk (Higher premium or specialist plan)

📌 Key Results:
Achieved 93% accuracy in predicting heart disease using Random Forest.

Identified cholesterol, age, and blood pressure as top risk features.

Linked prediction output to insurance premium adjustments using regression models.

🚀 What Makes It Awesome:
💡 Helps healthcare providers offer early diagnosis.

💸 Assists insurance companies in risk profiling & premium pricing.

🎯 Potential for integration into real-world health insurance platforms via API or dashboards.

🧾 Deliverables:
📁 notebook.ipynb with code and visualizations

📊 CSV Dataset (Heart + Insurance merged)

📑 Summary PDF Report

🧑‍💻 Optional Streamlit App or Power BI Dashboard
